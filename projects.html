              This is a small project that I've done recently for my internship. My task was to make a button on the top of the screen which
              opens up a model to edit how big a group you'd want for a trip. The purpose of this project was just to familiarize myself with
              the layout of the new app we're making at my internship. Additionally, it made me think about the user's experience as their 
              interacting and scrolling through the app.

              Last semester I took an AI and Robotics course at St Thomas and part of the course had us build a lego mindstorm robot with
              instructions and then program it to write a four letter word on a piece of paper using python. The purpose of this project was 
              to get hands on experience with robotics which connects code to some action done by the robot.

              This is a personal project that I started a couple of summers ago because I wanted to learn how to use the framework known
              as react native which is popular for making mobile apps that can be run on both ios and android devices. React native is technology
              used in the app at my internship as well. Additionally, this app is an unbeatable tic-tac-toe game that implements a recursive minimax 
              algorithm which I later learned about in lectures from my AI and Robotics class mentioned before!
