            <p style="font-size: 20px">My name is Joshua Kahlbaugh and this is my website! I'm currently a senior in college at the University of St Thomas 
              pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science. I'm originally from Duluth Minnesota, and it took
              a little bit of time for me adjust to living in a big city. I like the outdoors and luckily I get to go on runs next 
              to the Mississippi river near St Thomas's campus. My plans for after college are to either work more at my internship
              to eventually become a fulltime engineer or to take a gap year and travel the world. If I traveled, then I'd want to 
              go overseas since I've never been outside of the United States before. I'd have my sights set on London, Paris, or Berlin.
              I feel that I've learned a lot from being in a big city and taking a step further to visit places across the world will
              really open my eyes to what's out there in the world!
